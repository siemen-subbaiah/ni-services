      <h4 className="my-3">Corporate Returns:</h4>
      <p>
        Tax returns for corporations are more complex than personal tax returns

        these returns.

        The above fees assume that your bookkeeping has been properly prepared.
        As is often the case, if the information supplied is on a spreadsheet,
        we must prepare the bookkeeping beforehand. This will require all
        supporting materials and in this case the fees can be higher than stated
        above.
      </p>
