      <h3 className="my-2">Quarterly Tax Installments</h3>
      <p>
        Tax installments are periodic income tax payments that the individual
        tax payer has to pay to cover the taxes that they otherwise would have
        to on April 30th of the follow year.You may have to pay your taxes in
        installments if not enough income tax was withheld from your income.
        These amounts may be based on the least of prior year, current year or,
        2 years back for first 2 payments and 1 year back for the last two. For
        HST annual filers, they must do HST installment payments if they paid
        over $3,000 in HST for the prior tax year. How do you calculate these
        amounts? Take the amount and divide by 4. You then pay 4 equal amounts
        on April 30th, July 30th, October 30th and January 30th of the next
        year. The rule is you must pay by the 30th day after the end of each
        calendar quarter. With both personal taxes and HST payments, you pay
        more taxes or get a refund depending on the figures in your personal tax
        and HST final returns. If you didn't pay taxes in installments and If
        the CRA has determined that you might have to pay your taxes in
        installments, they will send you an Installment Reminder that suggests
        the amounts and the dates the payments are due.The installment threshold
        for individuals has increased to $3000 or $1800 if you were a resident
        of Quebec.

        Filing Late Tax Returns & Penalties For Late Tax Returns
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Interest</li>
        <li>
          If you have a balance owing for 2020, you are charged compound daily
          interest starting May 1, 2021, on any unpaid amounts owing for 2020.
          This includes any balance owing if your return is reassessed. In
          addition, you will be charged interest on the penalties starting the
          day after your return is due. The rate of interest you are charged can
          change every three months. If you have amounts owing from previous
          years, they will continue to charge compound daily interest on those
          amounts. Payments you make are first applied to amounts owing from
          previous years.
        </li>
        <li>Late-filing penalty</li>
        <li>
          If you owe tax for 2019 and do not file your 2020 return on time, you
          will be charged a late-filing penalty. The penalty is 5% of your 2020
          balance owing, plus 1% of your balance owing for each full month that
          your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you were charged a late-filing penalty on your return for 2017,
          2018, or 2019, your late-filing penalty for 2020 may be 10% of your
          2020 balance owing, plus 2% of your 2020 balance owing for each full
          month that your return is late, up to a maximum of 20 months.
        </li>
        <li>Failure to File Income Tax & Penalty for Not Filing Taxes</li>
        <li>
          If you owe tax for 2020 and do not file your return for 2020 on or
          before May 2, 2021, the CRA may impose penalties and interest. They
          will charge you a late-filing penalty. The penalty is 5% of your
          balance owing, plus 1% of your balance owing for each full month that
          your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months. Your late-filing
          penalty may be higher if you were charged a late filing penalty in any
          of three previous years
